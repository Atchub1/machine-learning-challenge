# Machine Learning Challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

I have created a few machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
 
Dataset and dataset definitions are from https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results 
* kepoi_name: A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at least one transit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent with a planetary transit hypothesis
* kepler_name: [These names] are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planets—a step up from the planet candidate designation.
* koi_disposition: The disposition in the literature towards this exoplanet candidate. One of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED.
* koi_pdisposition: The disposition Kepler data analysis has towards this exoplanet candidate. One of FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE.
* koi_score: A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value indicates less confidence in that disposition.
